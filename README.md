# Butterfly-image-classification
This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify butterfly species from images and provides interesting facts about each identified butterfly. Built with TensorFlow and Streamlit, the application allows users to upload a photo of a butterfly, classify it, and learn a fun fact about the species.

## Features
- **Image Classification**: Classifies uploaded butterfly images into one of 75 species.
- **Fun Facts**: Displays a unique fact about each butterfly species.
- **Interactive Interface**: Users can easily upload photos and view results in an aesthetic interface.
- **Sidebar Information**: Detailed instructions and additional app information are available in the sidebar for a user-friendly experience.

## Usage
Visit the [Butterfly Classification Application](https://butterfly-image-classification-h9vj2mmyklnx88hee5nkjt.streamlit.app/), upload a butterfly image, and the app will classify the butterfly species and display a fun fact.

## Model Information
- **Model Architecture**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) created in TensorFlow, trained for classifying butterfly species.
- **Input Preprocessing**: Images resized to 128x128 pixels, normalized for optimal model performance.
- **Classes**: 75 butterfly species.
- **Final Model Accuracy**: 80%
